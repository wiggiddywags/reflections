1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

>> A Git repository for the current dir is created. (Git doesn't create any commits for you. You'll have to create the first commit yourself.) To create and initialize a repository and also the meta data for that repo.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

>> Staging area is less like its own entity and more like an Intermediate step between the Working Dir. and the Repository. A waiting area before you board a plane. Each file add is like a passenger waiting on the flight. they haven't committed to the flight yet and can still back out (reset) before getting on the plane. (probs. a dumb analogy, but you get the idea.)  

3. How can you use the staging aread to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

>> You can use 'git diff --staged' to compare the Staging Area to the latest repository commit and look at what you are adding to see if its just a single logical change

4. What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

>> Experiments and different types of Testing to your app can be assigned to different branches, that way you can mess around with those without breaking your main (master) application. Branches can show the history of those experiments.

5. How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
 
 >> Allows you to quickly and easily see your commit tree structure and where you've branched.
