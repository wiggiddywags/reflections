1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

>> A Git repository for the current dir is created. (Git doesn't create any commits for you. You'll have to create the first commit yourself.) To create and initialize a repository and also the meta data for that repo.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

>> Staging area is less like its own entity and more like an Intermediate step between the Working Dir. and the Repository. A waiting area before you board a plane. Each file add is like a passenger waiting on the flight. they haven't commited to the flight yet and can still back out (reset) before getting on the plane. (probs. a dumb analogy, but you get the idea.)
