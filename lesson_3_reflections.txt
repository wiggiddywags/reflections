1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local? 

>> When multiple peope are working on the project (using different computers).
   When you want to colaborate with others on GitHub with your project.
   Good as a remote back up as well.
   
2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

>> Hmm... Well if your local repository is the lastest version and the most up-to-date history of your project's commits, and GitHub automatically updated your local repo, it would overwrite your latest with an older commit history. You would lose your data.
